### Change Logs

#### 1.4.0-rc.2 (2026.09.14)

- Fix: Plugin does not respect absolute path in "AIMP's Preferences - Player - Additional Information - Lyrics" section

#### 1.4.0-rc.1 (2026.09.12)

> This is an accumulated pre-release version that brings a few enhancements, fixes and code refactors committed past month.

- Feat: Lyrics editor now also caches metadata(e.g. artist) information while editing
- Feat: Add a preference to ignore empty lyrics lines
    - The preference can be set separately among different play styles
    - Two-Line play style enabled this by default because it should be more acceptable behavior
- Feat: Allows to change character encoding used for reading lyrics files
    - It can be accessed via lyrics playing window's context menu
    - It also supports setting per-file
- Optimize: Majority part of plugin's translation now changes immediately after user changes AIMP's language
- Optimize: Plugin's theme color now changes immediately after user changes AIMP's theme color
- Optimize: Better with plugin windows' closing behavior when AIMP exits
- Fix: Some fonts(like 幼圆YouYuan) failed to render their bold variation
- Fix: Horizontal scroll play style's fade in/out appearance is incorrectly affected by text shadow
- Fix(#11): The switch on preference window to toggle lyrics playing window will cause exception if user toggled on/off quickly
- Refactor: Whole lyrics player window implementation, prepare for multi-window feature(#8)
- Chore: Removes lyrics editor's icon from AIMP's context menu, as it renders not well under different themes and skins
- Other minor optimizations and fixes

#### 1.3.4 (2026.08.16)

- Feat: Introduce dark/light theme for sub-windows(preference window and etc.), currently it follows AIMP's night mode preference
- Feat(windows 11 only): Sub-windows now set mica backdrop as default, on windows 10, it falls back to pure color
- Feat: Ever annoyed by the fact that lyrics playing window will reload after preference applied? Good news is, since this release, only partial preferences will trigger the reloading(which is necessary)
- Feat: Add "toggle click-through" on lyrics playing window's context menu
- Fix: Incorrect position calculation when two-line placement is "center"
- Fix: Plugin crashes if user closes lyrics playing window while preference window is also open
- Optimize: As automation tests go further, crash is spotted on a fresh new windows installation, that's because a basic Visual C++ Redistributable installation is still required, to get away trouble installing it, plugin has included required dlls(msvcp*.dll and vcruntime*.dll), for technical information, please refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/determining-which-dlls-to-redistribute?view=msvc-170
- Chore(dep): Upgrade "Microsoft.Web.WebView2" to 1.0.4129.50
- Chore: change lyrics playing window's default background to black, which in my opinion looks better
- Other minor optimizations and fixes

#### 1.3.3.1 (2026.08.10)

- Fix: Add back missing lyrics scroll window resizing resources before v1.3.3, they are accidentally removed by me while enhancing WPF.UI related resources in v1.3.3

#### 1.3.3 (2026.08.08)

> This is majorly a maintenance version which introduces UI automation tests, which helps identify bugs.

- Feat: Happy to announce that plugin's brand icon is finally added, which is designed by **杨桃 Yiting**
- Feat: Add about dialog, so there is a place to show plugin's icon and credits
- Feat: Preference window now adds "reset to default" buttons for each group
- Feat: Add localization file entries for Lyrics Editor
- Feat: Add a preference to configure text alignment for multi-language lyrics
- Feat: Add a preference to configure two-line placement(center, left-right or right-left) for Two-line play style, thus "two-line reverse" preference is dropped
- Feat: Aware of precise lyrics(or enhanced lyrics with A2 extension), precise timestamps will only be removed at current version, (in future version, karaoke mode will add support for it)
- Fix: Fade duration preference not being applied immediately when "Apply" button is clicked
- Optimize (Better with lyrics playing window positioning): reset itself back to edge of screen instead of center screen if its position is out of screen when startup
- Optimize (Preference Saving logic): Preference with default value no longer writes to "AIMP.ini"
- Other minor optimizations and fixes

#### 1.3.2.1 (2026.07.23)

- Fix(#10, AIMP6): Plugin's newly added gatekeeper layer failed to load underlying .NET plugin on AIMP6
- Feat(#9): Add Indonesian Localization (by @naturbrilian)

#### 1.3.2 (2026.07.19)

> Since this version, plugin will be mainly dispatched as `.aimppack` formats, to get plugin files without installation, rename it to `.zip`.

- Feat: Add a preference to control non-synchronized lyrics playing behavior, user can choose to stack such lyrics vertically(default behavior) or horizontally, play with current play style(old behavior), or even do not show them at all (Suggested by many people including Soolo and Kenji Wolfgang)
- Fix: Under karaoke mode, some font text gets incorrectly truncated at the edge, e.g. character `g`'s tail gets truncated on some fonts
- Fix: Incorrect theme color under AIMP 6
- Optimize: Lyrics Editor now reads non-synchronized lyrics
- Optimize: Add a gatekeeper layer which prevents plugin from crashing if corresponding .NET Desktop Runtime is not installed or plugin confliction occurs, a notification will be displayed at that time, which is friendly for new users
- Add(CI): As .NET 8 will soon reach its end-of-support date, plugin files targeting .NET 10 is added since this release. It is recommended to install .NET Desktop Runtime 10 and use corresponding plugin files
- Optimize: Dispose webview process completely if user closes lyrics playing window
- Other minor optimizations

#### 1.3.1 (2026.07.05)

- Feat(#7): Allow "Fade Animation Max Duration" preference of One Line Fade-In-Out play style able to be set down to 0, at that time, lyrics player acts like movie subtitle player (Suggested by **@The-Fae-Sorceress**)
- Feat: Add a preference to disable lyrics playing window always showing on top (Suggested by **Kenji Wolfgang** on AIMP forum)
- Fix: Letter spacing animation of One Line Fade-In-Out play style will not play the first line after user seeks playback
- Other minor optimizations

#### 1.3.0 (2026.07.04)

- Feat: Add Karaoke Mode alongside these features
    - Ability to style karaoke inactive parts' font color, shadow color and text stroke color, corresponding configurations appear on preference window when karaoke mode is enabled
    - Ability to change karaoke transition area width. If set to 0%, there is no transition area, which many people may prefer
    - Karaoke mode supports all 3 play styles
- Feat: Add an preference which enables outer text stroke, which in my opinion looks better than inner text stroke(the old one)
    - Limitation(s):
        - In karaoke mode, outer text stroke is always enabled
        - Outer text stroke does not support hollow text, i.e. if setting font color to a transparent value, text stroke inner part will not be transparent
- Feat: Enhance text shadow settings, add shadow implementation preference:
    - The default text shadow implementation does not look well when text stroke is enabled, so "stroke shadow" is introduced in this version, which looks better when text stroke is enabled
    - The default value of shadow implementation preference is "Automatic", which enables "stroke shadow" only when text stroke is enabled and is recommended
    - For advanced users, you can choose to enable one or both of them.
    - Limitation(s):
        - In karaoke mode, only "stroke" shadow implementation can be enabled, this preference has no effect under karaoke mode
- Feat: Allow negative value for letter spacing preference, because some font family is spotted to be very loose even if letter spacing is 0
- Optimize: Letter spacing animation in one line fade-in-out play style
- Feat: when user sets transparency of background color to a very small value, mouse hovers on lyrics floating window will make background less transparent, because transparent floating window is not transparent for mouse clicks(as Artem previously points out), which may confuse users. If you don't want this feature, just enable "click-through" preference.

#### 1.2.5.fix2 (2026.06.19)

- Fix an issue that Two-Line play style may not play the lyrics line whose preceding line duration is too small (bug reported by Soolo)
- Fix an issue that lyrics scroll window will not re-appear if user switches song quickly

#### 1.2.5.fix1 (2026.06.16)

- Fix Two-Line play style will not clean up stage if switching to a song without lyrics (bug reported by **Soolo**)

#### 1.2.5 (2026.06.14)

#### 1.2.3 (2026.06.04)

- Fix(#6): At the edge of playing lyrics, shadow effect may be blocked by an invisible area, this happens because lyrics playing area is not set to full width of owner window
- Fix inconsistent .NET `System.Convert` behavior among Windows OS with different regional format (Thanks for **Soolo** reporting the issue!)
- Fix some memory leak issues as **Artem** points out (Thank you AIMP creator!), and with the help of CRT Library, some native C++ code is refactored in this update to get away such issue as much as possible

- optimize(#6 related): Add lyrics window edge feather effect and a corresponding preference to set feather width
